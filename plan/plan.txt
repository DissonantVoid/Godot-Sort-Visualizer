Current Task: refactoring/improvements (files, functions, signals, etc..)


Todo:
	-allow user to change visualizer scene at run-time
	-save options to file
	-replace some buttons with icons
        -sfx

Plan:
  -keep sorting implementation code independent so we can apply the sort on any custom scene
  -sorters:  bubble-sort, selection-sort, insertion-sort, quick-sort, merge-sort, heap-sort, radix-sort
             shell-sort,  gnome-sort    , bitonic-sort,   bogo-sort 
  -visualizers:
      -planets of different sizes rotating arround a star, each step we switch position between 2 planets lol
      -humans shooting zombies, each human shoots a type of zombie, but each type require specific weapon
      -lazers of different colors shooting inputs of matching colors, need sorting
      -?? (that's all I can think of)

UI guide:
  -pallete: 3 left color used for background/panels etc.., 3 right colors used for ui (button etc..)
  -no UI focus
  -all clickables should have a hand pointer
