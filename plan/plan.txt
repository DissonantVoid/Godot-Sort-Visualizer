Current Task: Merge sort
Next Task: Final touches

Todo (also see in-code todos by searching in all files for "todo"):
  -replace some buttons with icons
	-sfx
  -sorters comments are inconsistent, some of them are more detailed than others
  -add more images to puzzle visualizer

Plan:
  -keep sorting implementation code independent so we can apply the sort on any custom scene
  -sorters (easy to hard):
		[X] Bubble sort,   [X] Odd-Even sort,    [X] Selection sort,
    [X] Insertion sort [X] Gnome sort,       [X] Shell sort,
    [X] Quick sort     [!] Merge sort,       [X] Heap sort,
    [X] Bogo sort

    [-] Radix sort (not possible, only works on comparable data like ints and strings, not indexes)
    [-] Bitonic sort (not possible, requires size of the sorted list to be power of 2, quite a shame)

  -additional sorters for the future (if I even come back to this project :<\ ):
    comb sort, gravity sort, flash sort, pancake sort

  -visualizers: there should be at least 5 visualizers
      -bunch of cakes in unmatching boxes, on each sort 2 cakes are moved into a conveyor belt
        and transfered to each other position
      -humans shooting zombies, each human shoots a type of zombie, but each type require specific weapon
      -something like this fanciness right here: https://youtu.be/2ck0JDMsQco

Keep in mind:
  Sorters:
     -since this is potentially an educational project, always keep a short description on how the algorithm works
      + wiki link and keep code easy to read
  UI:
     -no UI focus
     -all clickables should have a hand pointer

Deadline: 2 months (around february 30)
