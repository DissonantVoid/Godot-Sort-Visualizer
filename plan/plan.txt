Current Task: GUI (algorithms picker functionality)
				  

Todo:
	GUI:
	 ability to choose algorithms
	 start/stop sorting
	 toggle manual steping/continues
	 hide ui
	 sort all steps at once


Todo (Future):
	-allow user to sort custom scene, the scene can be set in the editor
	as an export variable 
	-replace some buttons with icons

Plan:
  -user can choose a sorting algorithm and lines will sort themselves
  -keep sorting implementation code independent so we can apply the sort on any custom scene

UI guide:
  -no focus
  -all clickables should have a hand pointer
