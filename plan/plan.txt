Current Task: refactoring/resolving TODOs and all sorts of cleaning
Next Task:    


Todo (also see in-code todos by searching in all files for "todo"):
	-allow user to change visualizer scene at run-time
	-replace some buttons with icons
	-sfx
	-disabled buttons don't look very disabled
        -add a benchmark scene that runs all available algorithms with a timer
        -reorganize themes, see if we can have theme inheritence, keep things organized early so we don't get overwhelmed
         like that one time :'(

Plan:
  -keep sorting implementation code independent so we can apply the sort on any custom scene
  -sorters (easy to hard):
		Bubble sort,   Selection sort,   Insertion sort
		Gnome sort,    Shell sort,       Quick sort
		Merge sort,    Heap sort,        Radix sort
		Bitonic sort,  Bogo sort

  -visualizers:
      -planets of different sizes rotating arround a star, each step we switch position between 2 planets lol
      -humans shooting zombies, each human shoots a type of zombie, but each type require specific weapon
      -lazers of different colors shooting inputs of matching colors, need sorting
      -bunch of cakes in unmatching boxes, on each sort 2 cakes are moved into a conveyor belt
	   and transfered to each other position

Keep in mind:
  Sorters:
     -since this is potentially an educational project, always keep a short description on how the algorithm works
      + wiki link and keep code easy to read
  UI:
     -pallete: 3 left color used for background/panels etc.., 3 right colors used for ui (button etc..)
     -no UI focus
     -all clickables should have a hand pointer
