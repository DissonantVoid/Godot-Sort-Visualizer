Current Task: GUI (art)


Todo:
	GUI:
	 ability to choose algorithms
	 start/stop sorting
	 toggle manual steping/continues
	 hide ui
	 sort all steps at once
	-allow user to change visualizer scene at run-time
	-allow user to sort custom scene, the scene can be set in the editor
	as an export variable
	-save options to file
	-replace some buttons with icons

Plan:
  -keep sorting implementation code independent so we can apply the sort on any custom scene
  -supports: bubble-sort, selection-sort, insertion-sort, quick-sort, merge-sort, heap-sort, radix-sort
             shell-sort,  gnome-sort    , bitonic-sort,   bogo-sort 

UI guide:
  -no UI focus
  -all clickables should have a hand pointer
