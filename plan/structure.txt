Project Structure:
this file documents how components in the project interact with each other
and how to customize and extend each component 

The main components here are Sorters and Visualizers;
sorters are scripts that contain the sorting algorithm, each script inherites
from sorter.gd and must override its virtual methods which are used to interact
with the algorithm.
visualizers are scenes that take input from a sorter and translate that visually
each visualizer must inherite from visualizer.tscn and override its virtual methods
which are used to pass and retreive information

the main scene handles movement of information and dependency between the components,
a visualizer must be supplied to the main scene as an export variable, while a sorter
can be chosen at run-time 

the algorithm picker is the main ui to help control how things work
